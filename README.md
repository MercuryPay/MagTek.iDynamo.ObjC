===================
XCode iOS application processing transactions to our web services platform.

3 step process to integrate to Mercury Web Services.

##Step 1: Build Request with Key Value Pairs
  
Create a NSMutableDictionary and add all the Key Value Pairs.
  
```
    NSMutableDictionary *dictionaryReq = [NSMutableDictionary new];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"118725340908147" forKey:@"MerchantID"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"Credit" forKey:@"TranType"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"Sale" forKey:@"TranCode"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"12345" forKey:@"InvoiceNo"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"12345" forKey:@"RefNo"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"MercuryHelper 1.0.1" forKey:@"Memo"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"Allow" forKey:@"PartialAuth"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"MagneSafe" forKey:@"EncryptedFormat"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"Keyed" forKey:@"AccountSource"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"C756513CF498BBBF462FEDBFBF732DD8434ACB2B28325D0C7323204F639AC68FFD2769B49020E0CD" forKey:@"EncryptedBlock"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"9500030000040C20001C" forKey:@"EncryptedKey"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"OneTime" forKey:@"Frequency"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"RecordNumberRequested" forKey:@"RecordNo"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"1.01" forKey:@"Purchase"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"test" forKey:@"Name"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"MPS Terminal" forKey:@"TerminalName"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"MPS Shift" forKey:@"ShiftID"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"test" forKey:@"OperatorID"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"4 Corporate SQ" forKey:@"Address"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"30329" forKey:@"Zip"];
    [dictionaryReq setObject:@"123" forKey:@"CVV"];
```
  
##Step 2: Process the Transaction

Create MercuryHelper object and call the transctionFromDictionary method with the NSMutalbeDictionary and merchant's password.

```
    MercuryHelper *mgh = [MercuryHelper new];
    mgh.delegate = self;
    [mgh transctionFromDictionary:dictionaryReq andPassword:@"xyz"];
```

##Step 3: Parse the Response

Parse the Response using in the transactionDidFinish delegate.

Approved transactions will have a CmdStatus equal to "Approved".

```
-(void) transactionDidFinish:(NSDictionary *)result {
    
    if ([result objectForKey:@"CmdStatus"]
      && [[result objectForKey:@"CmdStatus"] isEqualToString:@"Approved"]) {
      
      // Approved logic here
      
    } else {
      
      // Declined logic here
      
    }
    
}
```
